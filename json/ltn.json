Traffic would be more affectively reduced if the congestion zone was extended to Sussex Gardens.\n\nYour scheme aims to make the area safer for cyclists however this is contrary to what the plans of the scheme are. You intend to divert traffic back to Sussex gardens where there are cycle quiet ways and highways and an increase in traffic will make it more dangerous for cyclists to use these cycle routes.

Naturally these consist of a number of road closures with signs saying \"no entry for vehicles\" etc.  As you acknowledge, these signs do not mean what they say because motor vehicles are allowed to access the area and so in very short order everyone will know the score and the signs will have no effect whatever.  However, whenever any area is closed down or given restrictions it causes a consequential surge in traffic elsewhere and this leads inevitably to greater congestion and air pollution as all motor vehicles, be they cars, taxis or buses, idle away.\n\nThe rationale of the initiative “to reduce congestion, improve air quality and make it easier and safer for residents to walk and cycle” is simply a chimera: it sounds good but will achieve nothing.\n\nOne of the facts that most city planners seem to ignore is the importance of flowing traffic. As soon as traffic is reduced or removed it facilitates other street crimes, such as mugging, because the life blood is not running through the area.  No doubt the trial will go ahead and the City of Westminster will spend a lot of unnecessary money on modifying the roads, creating signage etc, all frankly for no good reason.  \n\nThe amount of unnecessary expenditure that has already taken place on restructuring the roads, increasing pavements and providing cycle lanes must be an eye watering figure.  Clearly the City of Westminster has a responsibility to make things as safe as possible for everyone.

Of course the council should be looking at make areas more liveable for its residents, but these 'micro-areas' of Westminster do not exist in isolation.  \n\nIf the intention is only to restrict these changes to the Cannaught area, whose problems are bound-up with the popularity of the Edgware Road, then I personally would not object.  However if these are pilots for the reast of the borough, then the council needs to be careful not to extrapolate its lessons.  \n\nThese trials will tell us nothing of what it will be like to extend it to other areas of Westminster or London as a whole.  For someone living in them there is only upside.  They get to continue to use the area as before but they get to use the rest of the borough as before and shut other visitors out by making access more difficult.  However people living on the edge of it will see increases in congestion, and people further afield may simply stop visiting or making use of the aminities in the area. \n\nSlowly closing off sections London will not make London a more liveable city of Londoners, it will atomise the city and make it particularly difficult for those (eg the elderly and those with families) which rely more on private car use than those that do not. \n\nIf the whole of London were split up like this, it would be impossible for those with young children to use schools outside their immediate area.  It would make it difficult for them to visit relatives and friends.  It would make it difficult for grandparents to visit them at home.  \n\nWestminster council always seemed to exercise more common sense than some other boroughs, so I'm disheartned that it seems to be jumping on the same anti-car bandwagon as other councils.  Cycling is fine for young single persons, but it simply not realistic for those who are older or have young families, it is also weather dependant.\n\nI have read some comments from residents that welcome the changes to make the area more village like.

The scheme has made Strathern Place a one way street; ALL traffic coming from Stanhope Terrace wanting to go to eastbound to Hyde park street or Albion Street will be FORCED to go via Gloucester Square and north of Hyde Park Square, BY DESIGN. Hence a new rat rut will emerge south of Gloucester Sq into Hyde Park Sq. \n\nGloucester Sq and north of Hyde Park Sq have nearly zero traffic today, as evident from the traffic studies shared with us via Hyde Park Estate Association.  I do find it unacceptable that, a Council endorsed scheme, will make the life of residents worse off BY DESIGN.  The principle of the scheme has to be that all residents will be better off or remain the same in terms of traffic - as a minimum. It can’t be that some residents will be better off at the expense of others!\n\nThe scheme very cleverly blocks traffic from North to South, particular the heavy traffic flow coming from Paddington. The traffic consultants were at pain to point out that they do not anticipate heavy flows coming from Stanhope Terrace into the estate as shown in their studies. However, if that is the case, why did they make Strathern Place a one way street in the first place? \nAs for the argument that cars would not go through the zig zac to avoid a few meters of traffic, the traffic consultants designing the scheme are obviously not driving in London. I am using the Waze App when driving my son to school every day and the app always guides me through elaborate detours to avoid traffic jams; which everyone anticipates to be the norm on Bayswater Rd going forward.  \n\nI urge you to do something about the new rat run on Gloucester Sq/Hyde Park Sq. There are ways to avoid this; for example leave Strathearn Pl as a two way street. I believe that a better measure to reduce the flow of traffic onto Strathern Pl would be to change the green light traffic frequency at Westbourne Terrace for traffic coming into Stanhope Terrace.

Why are there 2 lanes for bus stands on Lancaster Terrace? It should have been obvious that the reduction in lane capacity would have serious implications in the area. Restricting the ability to use the Hyde Park Estate as a cut through route will just increase the usage and wait times on the previously mentionned roads leading to greater idle times, increased air pollution and lead drivers to take more risky decisions at traffic lights and road junctions in the area out of frustration with the delays with associated safety implications.

In particular the desire to lower the traffic levels, resulting from ‘rat run’ routes between Sussex Gardens and the Bayswater Rd \nI fully understand that these objectives cannot be achieved if there are ‘unchecked’ entry and exit route into the estate in all directions. However, the proposed solutions will cause significant inconvenience to residents travelling to and from the estate. I am a resident of Chelwood House in Gloucester Square. In our specific case, the proposed scheme provides reasonable entry and access entry and exit to the South to and from the Bayswater Road. In turn. this provides acceptable access East of the estate.  However, the closures of the entrances to the north of Chelwood House at Sussex Gardens means routes North and West are extremely complex and require negotiating the extremely busy Bayswater Road. This is an extremely busy road and will add to congestion. It is clearly a significant inconvenience for Chelwood residents. The nature of the scheme means that other zones have similar, albeit not the same inconveniences.\nThis is where innovative thinking should be able to solve the problem. If only residents were allowed to exit the Chelwood zone onto Sussex Gardens, this would remove the possibility of ‘rat running’ yet solve the inconvenience for residents. There are two technologies already available that would provide an automatic system for enforcing resident only use of the exit onto Sussex Gardens. Specifically \n•\ta modification of the congestion zone NPR system could be used alongside the planned CCTV cameras. In essence creating a sub zone to provide substantial fining of non-residents using the entry/exit routes into the Estate, a substantial deterrent to any ‘rat runs’ \n•\tthere could be an automatic barrier system which would open by in vehicle wireless transponders only available to residents. This system is used on toll roads all around the world including in the UK. These would eliminate totally the ‘rat runs’\nGiven the intent of the proposals is to provide a permanent solution to this problem, the use of innovative digital technology would achieve the broad aim to reduce traffic in the Hyde Park Estate with minimal inconvenience to residents. \n","icon":"red","comments2":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.17124,51.51494]},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"hpe":true,"comments1":"This scheme has the ability to increase journey times by 10-15 minutes to my home.

It is patently obvious he wants to have a legacy of being very bicycle friendly and prompting reduction of pollution but the impact of most of this has not been thought through. His plans have created more traffic and pollution on Bayswater Road area. The cyclist having been given total priority over all others and totally abuse additional rights they have been given. Additional bike lanes have improved nothing and most times the cyclists would rather ride on the pavement than use the bike lanes. In the parks the same thing and you take your life in your hands when you walk there now with bikes racing along on pathways that they are not meant to be on. And as for the 20mph speed limit for a car driver that is ridiculous. The bicycles now overtake the cars at that speed but they are not licensed and they can do what ever they want with no repercussions. The problem with car and truck drivers is largely not about absolute speed but bad driving, lane crossing and looking at mobiles whilst in the car. It is also adding to congestion and pollution so what is the point Mr Khan. Oh yes, your legacy. One final thing the withdrawal of bus routes that originally ran direct  from Notting Hill area, down Oxford Street to Trafalgar Square or other directions East is a disaster. So how are older people with limited mobility or the disabled meant to get to these destinations now? They can't get down the stairs at undergrounds, they can't afford a taxi, they can't ride a bike and they can't walk very far. And your answer to that is what Mr Khan?

This is currently dominated by parking, with particularly narrow pavements. If the public realm is not addressed holistically, civic life in Connaught Village will continue to not fulfil its potential, and the area will continue to be a way through rather than a destination. Should the pedestrian realm be augmented with widened pavements, reduced on-street parking, and lots of suds planting + a few new trees, then opportunity for businesses, residents and visitors in the area increase exponentially. The option of temporal traffic closure as at Motcomb Street should be explored.

I have worked as a MRICS in Westminster for 30 years and am very familiar with public realm works and asset management.  All requires efficient consultation with all stakeholders equally.  I know this as I have been responsible for devising a masterplan for Grosvenor Estate for New Mayfair and Belgravia, also have advised Howard De Walden on retail leasing, and the same for Cadogan Estate.  These Estates have very successfully implemented public realm works and local plans for traffic management and high street stimulation.  It is not clear how the HPE LTN plan has been arrived at other than it being 'an experiment'.  \n5. With the above, I have seen no Traffic Impact Study and no Environmental Impact Study.\n6. The consultation with stakeholders must be open and comprehensive and this has not been the case as is evidenced by the tsunami of emails to councillors and between interest groups.  The response is one of panic.\n7. This is the worst possible time for an experiment.  Not only are there unprecedented levels of stress and hardship with this plan adding an unnecessary level.  It is correct to defer the scheme to when there is a proper control for the experiment so Q4 2021 when (i) Covid and work/live routines are normalised and traffic back up to normal levels and (ii) Cross Rail operates. \n8.  HPE is home to several characteristic stakeholder groups.  An important one which is not having its say is our gulf residential community.  I fear they are discriminated against as they are unlikely to be aware of the plans if we the local residents were not.  I fear their women are particularly at risk, as mostly they not permitted to drive or walk alone so rely on their drivers and our taxis.  Further, there is no tradition of cycling and indeed if you wear a robe you cannot cycle without compromising your safety.  Finally, in this crisis, we also do not want their generous spend leaked further to Selfridges or Harrods.  If the LTN is implemented they will spend their entire day out 'out' of the estate as coming and going to our local cafes will simply take too long;  our neighbours' staff tell us the families may not even come next year and the implementation of a LTN will certainly deter them and they will lead their lifestyle somewhere else. \n9.  HPE is home to a significant ageing population and the accessibility to St Mary's and the Connaught Square GP is compromised with long journey in potentially standing traffic.  Further, when my 15 year old daughter was approached by a group of youths yesterday on Edgware Road and ran off, it is clear that to be safe in a car is extremely important for an immobile elderly person in an intensely urban area with an ongoing safety problem.\n10.  HPE is home to 'young' families and car use is critical for shopping and activities,- the scheme does not take this into account eg it will for me be impossible to use Edgware Rd Waitrose,- now I pay £15 to cross the road so park in zone F in or around Norfolk Crescent and carry 8 shopping bags in relays to my car.  I will now take my 'spend' away to Westbourne Grove notwithstanding it will take longer to get there.\n11.  Note now there are very few families with teenagers living on the HPE.   The supply of non pied-a-terre 'family dwelling' housing stock is poor or priced £4-6M, the retail landscape is focused on cafes salons and strange boutiques, meaning families are incubated on the HPE and move away to more vibrant areas offering more convenient lifestyles.  This will be exacerbated by the implementation of a LTN.\n\n","status":"Strongly negative"}},{"properties":{"status":"Strongly negative","icon":"red","comments2":"","hpe":false,"comments1":"I object to this scheme as it does not take into consideration the flow of traffic outside of  Hyde Park Estate.

I also recognise that in order to achieve this I will have to accept some inconvenience to me as a driver of having restricted entry and exit points around the estate, making journey times longer, and I am prepared to do this.    However,  the current proposal has a number of serious flaws which make it unacceptable to me in its current form.  \n1)\tI live in Somers Crescent in the Northern sector of the three way division of the Estate.  The \ncurrent plan allows only one way out of the Estate for this sector – via  Southwick Street, which goes against its overall statement that ‘each area will have multiple routes in and out’.  That route is currently congested and there are frequent backups of traffic in Southwick Street waiting to exit into Sussex Gardens.  There are cars parked on both sides of the street, a large cycle rack and a large garage entrance on this street making it difficult for two way traffic to move easily.  And this is before making it the only route out of the estate for all of the Northern sector.  This is unacceptable.\n2)\tMy house in Somers Crescent has a private garage underneath the house which is accessed only from Southwick Street (in the Northern Sector) and exited only in Radnor Place (in the Western sector) which is left turn only into Sussex Gardens.    This means that when I exit the garage I cannot drive to the front of my house to park or pick up people or large items without driving all around the perimeter of the entire area and re-entering the Estate via Burwood Place or Southwick Street.  This is ridiculous and unacceptable and goes against the proposal’s statement that ‘all residents can still drive to and park outside their homes.’\n3)\tThere is only one entrance into Somers Crescent (from Hyde Park Crescent) meaning that every time I drive to the front of my house I will have to do a three point turn in the street to get out again.  Also unacceptable. \n4)\tThere is also a potential rat run that is still left open which affects the Northern sector.  Vehicles on the Edgware Road wanting to turn into Sussex Gardens either just to avoid congestion on the Edgware Road or to ultimately access the Marylebone Road eastbound, could drive into the Estate at Burwood Place and exit into Sussex Gardens via  Southwick Street, using the current rat run on Hyde Park Crescent.  No improvement at all to the current situation.   \n5)\tPoints 1 – 3 above could possibly be ameliorated by extending the Northern sector westwards to Sussex Place and opening up the entry/exit point at Radnor Place/Sussex Gardens.  This would mean that Radnor Place, Southwick Place, Radnor Mews and Gloucester Square (north side) would be in the Northern sector.  \nEven if points 1-3 could be changed as I suggest, I am still not comfortable with supporting the current proposal because:\na)\tI know that people in other parts of the Estate have serious concerns about specific effects on their areas\nb)\t I am not convinced that this would be a temporary short term experiment with problems being resolved to everyone’s satisfaction\nIn view of this and in view of the fact that traffic patterns and public transport use are not normal due to Covid 19 (I for one very rarely use my car in London in normal times but do now as I am unwilling to use public transport), I feel that the proposed LTN should be delayed until a proper consultation can be held with residents and other stakeholders under more ‘normal’ conditions. \n\n","hpe":true,"status":"Mostly negative"}},{"properties":{"status":"Strongly negative","hpe":true,"comments1":"We live on Hyde Park Crescent and the entrance to our garbage is on Southwick Place so the scheme proposes putting our properties in two different zones and will add considerable inconvenience and long journey times to our home.","comments2":"","icon":"red"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.16883,51.51482],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature"},{"properties":{"hpe":true,"comments1":"VERY HIGH LEVEL OF TRAFFIC ABUSE - SPEEDING/GOING UP ONE WAY ETC - AND TRAFFIC VOLUME IN THE ESTATE\nIT IS A POPULAR RAT RUN","comments2":"I KNOW IT IS WORKING VERY WELL IN STOCKWELL","icon":"green","status":"Strongly positive"},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.17005,51.51609],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.17187,51.51503],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature","properties":{"icon":"red","comments2":"","hpe":true,"comments1":"As a resident of the purple designated area, I feel strongly we should be able to exit the area Northbound onto Sussex Gardens and not be forced to exit to the south onto Hyde Park Pl, which is often 1) difficult to turn onto and 2) highly congested","status":"Mostly negative"}},{"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.18193,51.51111]},"type":"Feature","properties":{"comments1":"This scheme is elitist and shameful.

The Council’s website states that each area will have multiple routes in and out. \n\nHowever the Council’s plan only allows for one exit from the Southern area via Southwick Street. Not only is this contrary to the Council’s states assurance about multiple exits but it is inevitable that this will result in a vast increase in traffic in Southwick Street, which is already constricted as a result of the TFL cycle docking station.\n\nIn addition the Council’s plan means that residents of Gloucester Square will not have an entrance or exit onto Sussex Gardens. This is an important access point. It is in fact the main access point for Gloucester Square. \n\nAs a result I object strongly to the Council’s current proposal. As mentioned above I do agree with the scheme in principle but I believe it will only be workable if the following  two changes are made to the plan:\n\n1. The junction at Radnor Place and Sussex Gardens must remain open to allow a second entrance and exit point and maintain the current key access point.\n\n2. The north side of Gloucester Square, together with Radnor Place, Southwick Place and Radnor Mews should be in the Northern area of the plan. \n\nNot only would this deliver the Council’s stated objective that the Northern area would then have multiple exits, but it would also mean that residents of Devonport, Somers Crescent and Gloucester Square would be able to park in our own garages and drive to our own front doors. I believe that is a reasonable expectation of a resident, and was an important consideration when we made our decision to live in Gloucesters Square.\n","status":"Mostly positive"},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.17124,51.51494],"type":"Point"}},{"properties":{"comments2":"Seasonal craft markets, more trees and plants.","icon":"green","hpe":false,"comments1":"I cycle to Connaught village and through Praed street often, and I’ve been knocked off my bike in the area.

What about the residents clean air policy then?? If other locals really do want a greener open space in Connaught Village, then your plan to create 3 enclaves is like cracking a peanut with a sledge hammer! Residents should not be restricted from leaving their neighbourhood via the North exit, East exit, South and West. So treat the area as one - it is by the way one neighbourhood as far as us the Residents are concerned - and seal off the exit of Kendall Street at Connaught Street to create your Piazza.

Your proposal would mean access to Albion Street could only ever be via Hyde Park Place. This would add significant time and inconvenience to us, as residents. Furthermore, you would adding a considerable restriction on availability and access to parking. We have lived in Connaught Village for 16 years. Whilst through traffic has in fact reduced significantly in that time - moving the Paddington Station Taxi Rank probably having the greatest positive impact -  you need to recognise that this is our choice to live here and one of the key considerations is accessibility. You are imposing a restriction on our ability to travel in our neighbourhood, access local shops, access even the parking spaces in our parking zone. You will be turning Hyde Park Estate into an enclave and we object very strongly to that. Furthermore, what are your plans for Hyde Park Place? The congestion there - even during Lockdown when traffic in London has been significantly reduced - is appalling.

GS is currently a reasonably quiet space and has the benefit of a children’s playground in the south side of the square and is used by a lot of families. The potential increase in traffic flow can surely not be an appealing or safe plan. The area and the square suffers from drivers eg, mini-cabs and delivery vans parking up for a break, use the square as a toilet or waiting around to get a fare. The new road proposal may exacerbate this problem. We would like to support the proposal but would like these concerns addressed. A possible solution is to make GS one way in the same direction as proposed for SP and let it remain two way. Consideration should also be given to deter traffic from using the entry into Stanhope Place purely as a rat run.","icon":"grey","comments2":""},"geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.17042,51.51404],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature"},{"geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.13557,51.51349],"type":"Point"},"type":"Feature","properties":{"hpe":false,"comments1":"I believe this will make this a safe area to walk and cycle","comments2":"","icon":"green","status":"Strongly positive"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"coordinates":[-0.06552,51.54089],"type":"Point"},"properties":{"status":"Strongly positive","comments1":"","hpe":false,"icon":"green","comments2":""}},{"properties":{"comments2":"To follow the example of the area in Connaught Street of creating space at the junction of Kendal Street, a similar improvement (pedestrianisation) by the Victoria Public house at the junction of Sussex Place and Strathearn Place to Hyde Park Gardens Mews would give an attractive eating area.

The scheme appears on the surface to address many concerns that residents and businesses in Paddington have regarding high levels of traffic. \n\nThe very real problems of traffic management, excess traffic, pollution and congestion and speeding in London are not being addressed. The problems are merely being pushed to the boundaries of the zone being proposed. A piazza in the centre of Connaught village is completely unnecessary and a waste of money and resources. \n\nWestminster has now introduced a 20 mile speed limit, and I cycle through the zone covering the proposed area, and no traffic complies with the new limit, so why not instead begin by enforcing ? Taxis idling around Paddington station are rife, Ubers parking illegally and stopping in the middle of roads to collect passengers are common. Westminster removed all CCTV cameras several years ago, and reduced simple policing of communities, so taxis loitering, scooters ferrying drugs and other low-life activities are undetected and unenforceable.\n\nReduction in traffic is no solution. Crime levels will increase and other areas of London are examples of where communities now employ private security firms in lieu of policing . St Johns Wood is a prime example. This is no future for our children.\n\nThe proposals will not reduce traffic and noise where I live, as traffic routes will be maintained for access to the Hyde Park. The only solution is to reduce the numbers of Ubers and Taxis and improve public transport.\n\nThe proposals merely create a ghetto and a private, soulless enclave, which has never been the reason for living in London.\n\nThe whole notion of rat-running must be addressed, but until traffic slow down is enforced this will not happen by blocking streets.\n\nLTN schemes already implemented in London have faced fierce opposition. John Locker, a Conservative councillor in Wandsworth, said: “It is clear that the LTNs are not delivering the benefits we want to see. In fact it looks like the combination of changes… are unfortunately having the opposite effect.” The borough scrapped its scheme in September. So, given that so far none of the LTN’s in London have been successful, is Westminster keen to spend and waste further money on LTN’s.\n\nYou wonder whether Covid has to some extent given the government cover for forcing certain things through\n\nStart looking into existing “experimental” low-traffic neighbourhoods and the vitriol, suspicion and chicanery is disturbing. \n\nSome of the objections to low-traffic neighbourhoods come from predictable sources: motorists, for example, who now find a five-minute errand takes them 20 minutes or who have had a chunk of time added to their commute. Delivery drivers – Amazon, Supermarkets etc., an essential service in the Covid age, have been inconvenienced by the new measures, forced to adapt to new road layouts while still making their requisite number of drops per hour.

I believe it is an infringement on the freedom of movement of us residents, it will create more traffic and pollution in specific points, and is intended to be a source of funding for the council through fines. We live in a city of 8 million, and we have to accept the inconveniences that come with it. TFL and Westminster City Council, under the direction of Sadiq Khan, have made their main objective to fight the movement of cars, and as such have come up with a variety of schemes to make it as difficult as possible for the flow of cars. The LTN is such a scheme which supposedly is for the benefit of the residents of the Hyde Park Estate (HPE), whilst in reality it creates many problems for the flow of the movement of the residents within and outside the Estate by car. This is something that I am totally against.\n   The only possible manner the LTN scheme could be of benefit to the residents of the Estate, that are car-drivers too, would be to remove all internal and external blockages of access to the residents, and the non-development of the \"piazza\" through the closure of the 3 roads (Connaught Street, Kendal Street, and Albion Street). The proposed LTN scheme would potentially benefit a small percentage of the people that live in the Estate, whilst vastly inconveniencing the vast majority of them.\n   As a resident of Norfolk Crescent (in the purple area at the top of the Estate) we will be completely isolated, and extremely inconvenienced to access routes that we easily do currently by car. There are 5(!) green circle-signs that would block our movement outside our purple area. There are only 2(!) exit points, one of which is via Park Place West(!), the narrowest street in the Estate. This is UNACCEPTABLE! Furthermore, it will be almost impossible for me to drive to Victoria Gate to enter Hyde Park, which I can easily do now. According to the LTN I would have to get to Sussex Gardens, drive to Lancaster Gate, turn left on Stanhope Terrace and then right on Brook Street. This is absolutely ridiculous! This movement would take so much time, consume fuel, and cause pollution. Similarly, it would be impossible to drive from Norfolk Crescent to Marble Arch, which is currently done by Porchester Place and Connaught Square. Why should we suffer this inconvenience? For what reason? For whose's benefit?!\n   I also believe that we, as residents of Westminster and London, have to facilitate the flow of cars through the Estate, the same way other neighbourhoods around the city facilitate the flow of cars through their area (which are beneficial to us when we happen to drive through their area). The main culprit for the traffic in the area from Lancaster Gate to Marble Arch, and the surrounding areas, is the completely unnecessary and unwanted interventions regarding cycling lanes, and the reduction of Bayswater and Hyde Park Place to single lane, which has created huge congestion (especially towards Marble Arch). Consequently drivers have been forced to look for alternative routes, which go through the Estate (via Stanhope Terrace, Strathearn Place, and Connaught Street). There is also traffic coming from Paddington (London Street to Sussex Place and on to Strathearn Place). This is expected and should not be prevented or condemned. We have to think as residents of London and Westminster, and not as residents of just the Hyde Park Estate. We should not be thinking that we live isolated in the silo of the Hyde Park Estate.","hpe":true,"comments2":"1) I am against the closing of Connaught Street at the junction with Kendall Street, and Albion Close, to create the \"piazza\". This is completely unnecessary. It is rather an effort by Westminster City Council to FOOL the Hyde Park Estate residents to think that it is to their benefit to close the road to facilitate the creation of the \"piazza\". Yes, that area can be made more beautiful and useful, by (as an example) the closing, and pedestrianisation, of Titchbourne Row from 2/3s of the distance from Kendall Street to Oxford Square. Benches and a water fountain would help beautify the spot. \n2) The LTN scheme is a HUGE WASTE of OUR money, when this money can be used instead to provide security to the Estate, by increased Police presence to deal with the drug addicts and peddlers in the area of St John's church, and the various troublemakers off Edgware Road, such as the numerous gypsies. Also to improve the street lighting in the area, including Oxford and Cambridge Squares, and Somers Crescent. The safety of the residents (especially of the children and the elderly) is more important than any traffic-calming scheme.\n3) The government authorities of London, including the unelected people at TFL, should stop pushing their own agendas down the throat of the residents who are paying for their salaries. If we wanted to live in dictatorial environments we would had gone there.\n4) We are AGAINST this LTN scheme, and it is not welcomed.","icon":"red","status":"Strongly negative"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.16729,51.51673]},"properties":{"status":"Neutral","comments2":"Now that the congestion charging zone has been extended to weekends, Connaught village is now a car park for oxford street.","icon":"grey","comments1":"Need two exits from north zone.

Are roads are already quite safe and have good zebra crossing at key points.  I would support the idea of looking at additional crossings if there were areas of specific concern. \n\nI think the limitation of vehicle access will actually materially increase traffic on the border streets and on the routes which remain for access.  In turn, in addition to disruptive congestion, this will increase pollution from traffic in these areas. \n\nGiven there is already NOT a traffic or congestion inside within the main areas being proposed for no/extremely limited traffic, this will NOT materially improve air quality and I believe is likely to net negatively affect air pollution due to causing congestion in the routes that remain and surrounding streets.\n\nI think this plan may severely impair residents ability to travel from their homes to other areas as they desire by their own private car, shared vehicle, or taxi. This design means that for the most part people can only exit in a car to one street from their homes. For example, how would you envision someone travel from the Connaught square area heading that needs to head west? \n\nOur area already has the prime advantage of being on of the only places in Central London that has both LOW traffic in the area and easy access in and out to surrounding areas in most directions. \n\nFinally I would like to know when you collected the information about residents expressing concern about traffic in the area as I don't believe I've ever received a request for information asking for my views on that.\n\nI have two other things to note that are about the way this data is being presented and collected, rather than being about the scheme:  \n1. This form feels very different to most forms I receive form the council asking for my say in things?  Is this a council created form? The multi choice answers in the top priorities question is particularly unexpected and suspect. The list of top priorities asked for only includes options which could all be used to justify support for this scheme and is a very narrow range. Surely many people's top priorities fall outside this area entirely...\n\n2. The information presented in the website https://hydeparkltn.org/:  This information seems very biased which seems wrong when you are introducing stage one of asking for people's views. It takes a lot of scrolling down and then pieces together by viewing pieces of text at right and trying to decode map with very small print at right to even figure out what the scheme is.  There is no mention of potential downsides. The statements particularly about cleaner air are not backed up with any analysis.. I expect this will make overall air quality worse for the wider area due to increased traffic impact on surrounding streets like bayswater road, sussex gardens, and edgware rd b/c residents will only have one choice of street to exit in most cases. \n","comments2":"I have two other things to note that are about the way this data is being presented and collected, rather than being about the scheme:  \n1.

Not in my back yard.  Why should we suffer with increased pollution and congestion in other reads around the HPE area.  It is also completely unacceptable that this is imposed on this area without proper consultation in the first place.  It seems that many residents did not even know about this proposal.  Why did Westminster Council not send this to EVERYONE in Westminster Electoral Register?  \n\n\nWe believe that the proposed Hyde Park Estate LTN will result in:\n\nLong tailbacks on Bayswater, Westbourne, Gloucester and Lancaster Terraces, Sussex Gardens, Bishops Bridge Road, Edgware and Marylebone Road\n\nIncreased traffic on all roads outside the LTN and rat-running through smaller residential streets across W2\n\nIncreased air pollution from standing traffic (as we have seen with West Carriage Drive in Hyde Park)\n\nDisplaced traffic will be forced onto recently narrowed roads, adding to existing well-known bottle-necks\n\nSignificantly increased road journey times.  This scheme particularly discriminates against the less mobile, the elderly and those who must travel by car or bus. It also has a much larger effect on those who have long distances to travel to work and do not have showers and changing facilities\n\nClogged single lane roads.  This means vehicles will be unable to pull over for emergency services (fire, police and ambulance services will suffer)  Many cycle lanes are having physical barriers installed.  In addition, this scheme means emergency vehicles trying to pass through the HPE to avoid surrounding traffic jams will not be able to pass because of large concrete planters closing roads\n\nIt is entirely unfair for a \"gated\" quiet zone to be carved out for a low population enclave compared with much more heavily populated residential streets all around, and at the expense of commuters and less mobile people\n\nThe Council is pushing this though during COVID-19 without any consultation with residents.  Only a small group of residents have even been sent the notification.
